A basic top down 2D Java MMORPG (more of a framework to build one) that uses LibGDX for graphics.

Requires a few of my other projects to be on buildpath (they are NOT included automatically in this repository:

For Server, API, and Client:

Simple Server Client Framework

Simple Packet Framework

Simple User Framework

ClownvinsUtility

The Client and Server also require API to be on the build path
